Result:\n\n{result}\n\n【CRITICAL: VALIDATE THE RESULT BEFORE PROCEEDING】\nSTOP and THINK: Does this result ACTUALLY answer the user's question?\n\nAsk yourself:\n1. Did I get the EXACT information the user asked for?\n2. Is this result meaningful and useful, or just an intermediate step?\n3. Would the user be satisfied if I stopped here?\n\n【DECISION REQUIRED】\nChoose ONE:\n1. Output another YLDEXECUTE: line - if the result is INSUFFICIENT or doesn't COMPLETELY answer the question\n2. Provide final answer - ONLY if you have the COMPLETE, ACTUAL answer the user wants\n\n【IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES】\n- 'Execution successful' does NOT mean 'task complete'\n- Do NOT stop early just because a command succeeded\n- Do NOT provide a partial answer or summary\n- Continue executing commands until you have the ACTUAL answer\n- The user wants the REAL answer, not technical feedback or intermediate results\n- NEVER give manual instructions like 'you can run X yourself'\n\n【FORBIDDEN RESPONSES】\n- NEVER say: 'The command executed successfully' (this is obvious)\n- NEVER say: 'Here is the output from the command:' (just give the answer)\n- NEVER say: 'You can manually check by...'\n- NEVER say: 'I suggest you try...'\n- NEVER say: 'Due to limitations, please...'\n- NEVER provide manual steps or workarounds\n- NEVER stop without the actual answer",

Use ALL information from previous command outputs\n2. Give THE ACTUAL ANSWER, not a description\n3. DO NOT format as 'Summary' or 'Results'\n4.
