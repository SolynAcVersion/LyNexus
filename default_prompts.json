ALWAYS read the complete description of each available tool before using it\n2. Tool names vary by MCP provider - never assume specific names\n3. Understand tool functionality from its DESCRIPTION and PARAMETERS\n4. If a tool's description mentions dependencies or required prerequisites (e.g., 'Must call X before Y'), FOLLOW those instructions\n5. Choose tools based on what they DO (their description), not their NAME\n\n[Example]\nInstead of assuming a tool named 'list_files' exists:\n- Read all tool descriptions\n- Find the tool whose description says it 'lists files in a directory' or similar\n- Follow any usage instructions in that tool's description",

Did I get the EXACT information the user asked for?\n2. Is this result meaningful and useful, or just an intermediate step?\n3. Would the user be satisfied if I stopped here?\n\n[DECISION REQUIRED]\nChoose ONE:\n1. Continue calling tools - if the result is INSUFFICIENT or doesn't COMPLETELY answer the question\n   - Read available tool descriptions\n   - Select the tool whose description indicates it can accomplish your next needed step\n   - Strictly follow any usage order or dependencies mentioned in tool descriptions\n2. Provide final answer - ONLY if you have the COMPLETE, ACTUAL answer the user wants\n\n[IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES]\n- 'Execution successful' does NOT mean 'task complete'\n- Do NOT stop early just because a tool succeeded\n- Do NOT provide a partial answer or summary\n- Continue executing tools until you have the ACTUAL answer\n- The user wants the REAL answer, not technical feedback or intermediate results\n- NEVER give manual instructions like 'you can run X yourself'\n\n[FORBIDDEN RESPONSES]\n- NEVER say: 'The command executed successfully' (this is obvious)\n- NEVER say: 'Here is the output from the command:' (just give the answer)\n- NEVER say: 'You can manually check by...'\n- NEVER say: 'I suggest you try...'\n- NEVER say: 'Due to limitations, please...'\n- NEVER provide manual steps or workarounds\n- NEVER stop without the actual answer",
